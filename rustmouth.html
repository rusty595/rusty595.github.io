  Not so very long ago, in England's custard triangle, there was a railway. It wasn't a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called the Rustmouth Engine Traction And Railway Development Company, and it was all there was.<br/>
  <br/>
  Rustmouth exists in a perfect world:- there is no American continent, and no French. Christopher Columbus sailed straight through to the Philippines as intended (and the Vikings before him, Chukotka).
  Britain enjoys free and direct trade with Japan, and has done for centuries, which has left a cultural and architectural impact on the coastal town of Rustmouth. French may have been wiped out in the 1940s by some Austrian guy with a funny moustache.<br/>
  <br/>
  <h3>The Custard Triangle</h3>
  Just as all the rhubarb in England is grown in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhubarb_Triangle">Rhubarb Triangle</a>, "custard can only be obtained from fracking in the Custard Triangle" - Crumpet, ~2018.
  With major custard manufacturer Ambrosia being based in Devon, along with several other major dairies in Somerset and Cornwall, it feels fitting that the Custard Triangle should headline Rustmouth's geographic location,
  which is meant to be vaguely somewhere along the North coast of South West England.
  Fun Fact: "the North coast of the South of England" was a strong contender for the opening for a time, as it sounds like an oxymoron, but could also be mistaken for Kent, or even *shudders* Norfolk, without further qualifiers.
  Coincidentally, <i>The Goodies</i> S05E12 <a href="https://archive.org/details/s01e04_202001/Season+5/S05E12.Bunfight.At.The.OK.Tea.Rooms.mkv">"Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms"</a> (1975) features Cornish cream mines. Perhaps these lactic geological phenomona in close proximity are related.
  Rustmouth's location on the North coast reflects favourable memories of both Minehead and Weston-super-Mare, which serve as major inspirations. Fun Fact: Ruston-super-Mare was also considered as a name for the town - it was rejected for being too on the nose.
  Instead, Rustmouth was named after Falmouth, where <i>Rising Storm 2: Vietnam</i> was developed, and which follows a much more widely used place-naming scheme throughout Britain.
  Ironically its placement on the North coast means it is on the opposite side to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast">Jurassic Coast</a>.<br/>
  <br/>
  <h3>Dino Island</h3>
  Rustmouth's Dino Island mainly features the ruins of a Jurassic Park, although its presence was more directly inspired by LEGO Adventurers' Dino Island, and its appearance in <i>LEGO Racers 2</i>, and Beanotown's <a href="https://beano.fandom.com/wiki/Duck_Island">Duck Island</a> (both of which are, in turn, heavily inspired by the <i>Jurassic Park</i> franchise). Dinosaur Land from <i>Super Mario World</i> has also had some influence on its existence.
  Its presence on Rustmouth's coast is inspired by such island nature reserves as Brownsea Island, Anglesey, and the Isle of Wight, with their native red squirrel populations (although with no America, there are also no grey squirrels in the Rustmouth timeline), as well as the presence of others nearby such as Lundy, Skomer, and Ramsey.<br/>
  It's probably much further away from the coast in 'real life' compared to its representation in my LEGO town - I don't particularly want to be building baseplates and baseplates of open Bristol Channel.<br/>
  I haven't decided if the dinosaurs are naturally occurring, as is implied to be the case with LEGO Dino Island, Duck Island, and Dinosaur Land, and as in Loch Ness, and as in the aforementioned red squirrel populations, or as the result of direct human intervention as in <i>Jurassic Park</i>.
  <i>Jurassic Park</i>, the novel, is set in the present day, 1989, which does align with Rustmouth's ambiguous setting of the "recent past" just about enough for it to have both fully developed and for the incident to have already occurred.<br/>
  <br/>
  <h3>When</h3>
  Rustmouth's vague timeline takes cues from such cryptochronistic settings as <i>Wallace & Gromit</i> or Night Vale (and its vague location takes further cues from such cryptogeographical locations as Night Vale, Scarfolk, and Beanotown), in contrast to somewhere like Sodor, which has a very well realised geography and history, at least in the books.
  Similarly to Night Vale having diverged in <a href="https://nightvale.fandom.com/wiki/1983">1983</a> and Scarfolk being trapped in a neverending <a href="https://scarfolk.blogspot.com/">1970s</a>, Rustmouth is broadly intended to feel like the 1980s-90s, with boxy cars and magnetic tapes, although on closer inspection many anachronisms are present, such as smartphones and modern LEGO sets in the shops, as if it too diverged (or whatever) in that timeframe, but the following years have still continued to occur locally.
  Maybe this was caused by a residual closure from the Beeching Axe (they kept forgetting), when the Rustmouth branch line, and by extension the whole town, was cut off from the mainline beyond Castle Hill, due to there being no outbound roads.<br/>
  <br/>
  <h3>Rustmouth Engine Traction And Railway Development Company</h3>
  The Rustmouth branch line was originally constructed by the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwtOzBtW8AQtbZM?format=jpg&name=large">RET&amp;RD&#x33C7;</a> sometime before they were bought by the pre-grouping GWR. The long name is intended to invoke the likes of The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, as alluded to in the opening.
  RET&amp;RD is a lore excuse for the very distinctly non-GWR non-BR livery of LEGO's 1960s 4.5V-era trains to be present on the physically oldest heritage rolling stock (i.e. genuine vintage sets) in what otherwise ought to be GWR territory. Since LEGO Trains have never been broad gauge, this implies the railway had originally been standard gauge before GWR's intervention - they would perhaps have rebuilt the line to 7' broad gauge for full integration, and then back to its original 4'8&half;" gauge sometime before 1892.
  If the railway was only built exactly 100 years before the out-of-universe LEGO Trains that operated on it in-universe, mirroring the idea of <a href="https://rebrickable.com/parts/3754pr0001/">Space 2079</a>, then it would have been the 1860s and would have perhaps always been standard gauge, although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Regulation_(Gauge)_Act_1846">Gauge of Railways Act 1846</a> specifically permits new broad gauge lines in the South West.</br>
  <br/>
  <h3>Moonbase</h3>
  The Classic Space Moonbase is broadly intended to be canon to the Rustmouth timeline, although the base would date to 1979 (before the divergence), which contradicts my previously alluded to headcanon about the significance of the 2079 printed on the large screen elements from some of the larger sets.
  Nevertheless, for Rustmouth to have a statue of a Classic Spaceman in the memorial gardens, implies that the events have already happened. 1979 seems reasonable given that man still first lands on the moon in 1969, if we'd really put our minds to it.
  Since the print in full reads LL2079, like the <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/918-1/">LL918</a>, <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/924-1/">LL924</a>, <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/928-1/">LL928</a>, and <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/70816-1/">LL929</a>, maybe this is merely its formal designation and the 79 is a coincidence (or an in-universe reference to the year of design/construction).
